\title{Point Estimation and Variance for the unit-level direct effect (ADE), marginal direct effect (MDE), and unit level spillover effect (ASE)}
\usage{
CalAPO(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the relevant variables. The names for the variables should be ``Z'' for the treatment assignment, ``Y'' for the treatment outcome, ``A'' for the treatment assignment mechanism, and ``id'' for the cluster ID. The variable for the cluster ID should be a factor.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{CalAPO} which contains the following items:
\item{Y.hat}{ Estimate of the average potential outcomes. }
\item{ADE.est}{ Estimate of the unit level direct effect. }
\item{MDE.est}{ Estimate of the marginal direct effect. }
\item{ASE.est}{ Estimate of the unti level spillover effect. }
\item{cov.hat}{ Conservative covariance matrix for the estimated potential outcomes. }
\item{var.hat.ADE}{ Estimated variance of the ADE. }
\item{var.hat.MDE}{ Estimated variance of the MDE. }
\item{var.hat.ASE}{ Estimated variance of the ASE. }
}
\description{
This function calculates the estimated average potential outcomes Y(z,a), point estimates for the ADE, MDE, and ASE, and conservative covariance matrix estimates.
}
\details{
